# Ecosystem Mapping

The Agentic ecosystem of DACs (Decentralized Autonomous Conglomerates) maps directly to the Four Core Layers.

This alignment ensures architectural clarity and long-term scalability.

---

## Intelligence Layer → Agentic Network

The foundational L1 powering autonomous, cross-chain Human–AI economies.

- AGNT standards
- Cross-chain cognition
- Autonomous coordination
- Web4 infrastructure

---

## Interaction Layer → Jam

The consumer operating system of the Agentic Internet.

- Messaging
- AI-native experiences
- Livestreams
- Installable Agents

Jam makes intelligence accessible.

---

## Value Layer → Chariot

The flagship RWA-focused DAC within Agentic.

- Tokenized real-world asset flows
- Capital routing
- Decentralized treasury logic
- Autonomous payment rails

Chariot activates economic coordination.

---

## Execution Layer → Orchard

The intelligent tokenized RWA liquidity exchange.

- Autonomous RWA sourcing
- Liquidity routing
- Procurement automation
- On-chain settlement

Orchard converts intelligence into deployed capital.

Each DAC and decentralized application built on Agentic is a layer expression of the same autonomous infrastructure.
