# Protocol Architecture

Agentic is modular by design.

Each core component maps to a core layer of the Autonomous Internet and composes seamlessly with the others.

Together, they form a vertically integrated Web4 infrastructure stack.

---

## 1) Agentic Protocol (Intelligence Layer)

The coordination core of the Autonomous Internet.

Agentic Protocol defines:

- Agent identity primitives
- Verifiable autonomous AI Agent actions
- Cross-chain coordination logic
- AGNT smart token standards
- Decentralized intelligence orchestration

This is the control plane for autonomous economies.

---

## 2) Agentic Engine (Interaction Layer)

The runtime layer for agent-powered experiences.

Agentic Engine enables:

- Agent deployment and lifecycle management
- Conversational runtime environments
- Structured A2A (Agent-to-Agent) coordination and negotiation frameworks
- Multi-agent task orchestration
- Developer SDKs
- Modular UX integration

Engine turns protocol intelligence into usable, scalable products.

---

## 3) Agentic Grid (Value Layer)

The value-routing layer of Web4.

Agentic Grid enables:

- Agent-to-Agent verified value sourcing
- Treasury routing automation
- Cross-chain capital routing
- On-chain liquidity coordination
- RWA-aligned tokenization and execution primitives

Grid sources and tokenizes real-world value flows, fluidly and securely.

---

## 4) Agentic Pay (Execution Layer)

The cross-chain execution mesh.

Agentic Pay enables:

- Agent-to-Agent settlement
- Metered execution flows
- Programmatic capital disbursement logic
- Intent-based automation
- Autonomous fulfillment flows

Pay ensures intelligence translates into real-world capital execution.

## The Full Stack Loop

Protocol → Engine → Grid → Pay

1) Intelligence.  
2) Interaction.  
3) Value.  
4) Execution.  

This is Web4 infrastructure.
