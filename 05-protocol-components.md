# Protocol Components

Agentic is modular by design.

Each component maps to a core layer of the Autonomous Internet and composes seamlessly with the others.

Together, they form a vertically integrated Web4 infrastructure stack.

---

## 1) Agentic Protocol (Intelligence Layer)

The coordination core of the Autonomous Internet.

Agentic Protocol defines:

- Agent identity primitives
- Verifiable agent actions
- Cross-chain coordination logic
- AGNT standards
- Decentralized intelligence orchestration

This is the control plane for autonomous economies.

---

## 2) Agentic Engine (Interaction Layer)

The runtime layer for agent-powered experiences.

Agentic Engine enables:

- Agent deployment and lifecycle management
- Conversational runtime environments
- Agent-to-Agent coordination frameworks
- Developer SDKs
- Modular UX integration

Engine turns protocol intelligence into usable, scalable products.

## 3) Agentic Pay (Value Layer)

The value-routing layer of Web4.

Agentic Pay enables:

- Agent-to-Agent settlement
- Treasury automation
- Metered execution flows
- Cross-chain capital routing
- Programmatic disbursement logic

Capital moves as fluidly as information.

---

## 4) Agentic Grid (Execution Layer)

The cross-chain execution mesh.

Agentic Grid enables:

- Liquidity routing
- Intent-based automation
- RWA-aligned execution primitives
- Autonomous fulfillment flows
- On-chain action coordination

Grid ensures intelligence becomes action.

---

## 5) Agentic Communication Layer

A standardized agent-to-agent coordination framework.

This layer enables:

- Structured A2A negotiation
- Intent exchange packets
- Permissioned tool invocation
- Multi-agent task orchestration
- Cross-domain coordination logic

This is the language layer of autonomous commerce.

## The Full Stack Loop

Protocol → Engine → Pay → Grid → Communication

Intelligence.  
Interaction.  
Value.  
Execution.  

This is Web4 infrastructure.
