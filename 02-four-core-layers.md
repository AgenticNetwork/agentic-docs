# The Four Core Layers of Agentic

Agentic is architected as a four-layer autonomous system.

Each layer is embedded within the geometric structure of the Agentic symbol — representing the emergence of Web4 infrastructure.

---

## 1. Intelligence Layer (Center Triangle)

The cognitive core of Agentic.

This layer enables:

- Cross-chain cognition
- Multi-Agent orchestration
- Decision engines
- Human–AI economic coordination
- Agentic Reasoning

It functions as the brain of the system.

All higher-level interactions originate here.

---

## 2. Interaction Layer (Top Triangle)

The communication surface between humans, agents, and systems.

This layer enables:

- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication middleware
- Conversational interfaces
- Human-AI-native UX
- Messaging & livestream surfaces
- Agentic Communication

It is the visible layer of Agentic — where intelligence becomes accessible.

---

## 3. Value Layer (Left Triangle)

The sourcing of value across humans, agents, and networks.

This layer enables:

- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) value sourcing
- Procurement automation
- Tokenized liquidity
- Cross-chain capital routing
- Agentic Liquidity

It is the monetary bloodstream of the ecosystem.

---

## 4. Execution Layer (Right Triangle)

The autonomous action layer.

This layer enables:

- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) payments
- Settlement rails
- On-chain execution
- Cross-chain payment routing
- Agentic Payments

It is the system’s arm — converting intelligence into real-world outcomes.

Together, these four layers form a self-coordinating, autonomous human–AI economy.
