# The Four Core Layers of Agentic

Agentic is architected as a four-layer autonomous system.

Each layer is embedded within the geometric structure of the Agentic symbol — representing the emergence of Web4 infrastructure.

## 1. Intelligence Layer (Center Triangle)

The cognitive core of Agentic.

This layer enables:

- Autonomous reasoning
- Cross-chain cognition
- Agent orchestration
- Decision engines
- Human–AI economic coordination

It functions as the brain of the system.

All higher-level interactions originate here.

## 2. Interaction Layer (Top Triangle)

The communication surface between humans, agents, and systems.

This layer enables:

- Conversational interfaces
- AI-native UX
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication
- Messaging & livestream surfaces
- Agentic Comms

It is the visible layer of Agentic — where intelligence becomes accessible.

## 3. Execution Layer (Left Triangle)

The movement of capital across humans, agents, and networks.

This layer enables:

- Autonomous payments
- Settlement rails
- Treasury routing
- Agent-to-Agent value exchange
- Agentic Pay

It is the monetary bloodstream of the ecosystem.

## 4. Value Layer (Right Triangle)

The autonomous action layer.

This layer enables:

- RWA sourcing
- Tokenized liquidity
- Procurement automation
- On-chain execution
- Cross-chain liquidity routing
- Agentic Liquidity


It is the system’s arm — converting intelligence into real-world outcomes.

Together, these four layers form a self-coordinating, autonomous human–AI economy.
