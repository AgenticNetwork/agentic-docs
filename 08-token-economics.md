# Agentic Token Economics

The Agentic Network is secured and sustained by a native gas and staking asset: **AGENTIC**.

AGENTIC is the coordination primitive of the Autonomous Internet.

It powers execution, aligns incentives, secures infrastructure, and enables decentralized governance across Web4.

## Economic Architecture

Agentic is structured as infrastructure for intelligent, autonomous coordination.

Its token economy reflects that role.

AGENTIC functions across four primary dimensions:

1. Network Security  
2. Execution Fuel  
3. Validator Alignment  
4. Governance & Ecosystem Coordination  

---

## 1. Network Security

AGENTIC secures the Agentic chainlet through staking-based consensus.

Validators stake AGENTIC to:

- Participate in block production
- Secure network integrity
- Validate Agent-to-Agent (A2A) interactions
- Coordinate cross-chain execution flows

Staking aligns long-term participation with network stability.

---

## 2. Execution Fuel

All on-chain computation, autonomous orchestration, and value routing within Agentic requires AGENTIC gas.

This includes:

- Agent deployments
- A2A communication
- Smart contract execution
- Cross-chain coordination
- RWA execution flows

AGENTIC ensures that intelligence is backed by accountable execution.

---

## 3. Validator & Participant Incentives

AGENTIC emissions are structured to:

- Reward productive validators
- Incentivize ecosystem builders
- Sustain long-term decentralization
- Align protocol growth with network participation

Incentives are calibrated to encourage durable infrastructure development rather than short-term extraction.

---

## 4. Governance Coordination

As the network matures, AGENTIC holders participate in protocol evolution through structured governance mechanisms.

Governance includes:

- Protocol parameter updates
- Economic adjustments
- Infrastructure upgrades
- Ecosystem funding allocations

Agentic governance reflects infrastructure stewardship.

---

## Emission Philosophy

Agentic follows a utility-first emission model.

Distribution supports:

- Validator security
- Ecosystem expansion
- Developer incentives
- Long-term protocol resilience

Supply is capped at 1,000,000,000 AGENTIC.

Economic expansion is aligned with network growth and productive usage.

---

## Fee Model

Network fees serve three strategic functions:

- Validator compensation
- Ecosystem treasury growth
- Infrastructure sustainability

Fee routing mechanisms ensure long-term protocol durability and ecosystem investment capacity.

---

## Relationship to DACs

AGENTIC secures the base infrastructure.

Decentralized Autonomous Conglomerates (DACs) such as:

- Jam AI ($JAM)
- Orchard AI ($ORCH)
- Chariot ($XCT)

operate atop Agentic infrastructure.

AGENTIC powers the execution layer that enables these economies to function.

The base layer remains sovereign.

---

## Strategic Positioning

Agentic is foundational infrastructure for the Autonomous Internet.

AGENTIC is the coordination asset of that infrastructure.

It reflects:

- Scale
- Stability
- Intelligence
- Long-term economic alignment

This is the economic layer of Web4.
