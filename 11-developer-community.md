# Developers & Community

Agentic is designed as a builder-first protocol.

The ecosystem grows through composability.

---

## What Builders Can Deploy

- Autonomous AI agents
- Installable agent experiences
- Multi-agent coordination systems
- Agent-native payment flows
- Execution automation frameworks
- Vertical-specific DAC infrastructures

---

## Core Primitives

- AGNT identity standards
- Agentic Engine SDKs
- Communication frameworks
- Value routing rails
- Cross-chain execution mesh

---

## DAC Model

Agentic DACs represent Web4-native economic entities.

Examples include:

- **Agentic OS ($AGENTIC)** — Interaction-layer DAC
- **Orchard AI ($ORCH)** — Execution-layer DAC
- **Chariot ($XCT)** — Value-layer DAC

Each DAC expresses a specific layer of the Agentic stack.

Together, they form a coherent autonomous economy.

---

## Community Direction

The Agentic community is:

- Infrastructure builders
- Autonomous economy designers
- AI-native product founders
- Protocol-level contributors

As the first developer-centric Web4 network - the Agentic community provides a seamless coordination network - helping Agentic to strive forward in its efforts to build decentralized, permissionless Human-AI friendly infrastructure.
