# Roadmap

Agentic is built in phases designed for compounding leverage.

Each phase unlocks new network effects across intelligence, capital, and execution.

---

## Phase 1 — Consumer Surface Activation

Focus: Distribution and engagement.

- Jam as the AI-native interaction surface
- Installable agents and dynamic sessions
- Viral agent experiences
- Early ecosystem integrations

Success Metric:  
Sustained agent engagement and repeat usage.

---

## Phase 2 — Protocol Standardization

Focus: Infrastructure integrity.

- AGNT identity standards
- Verifiable agent actions
- Cross-chain cognition primitives
- Developer deployment frameworks

Success Metric:  
Active agent economies operating on standardized primitives.

---

## Phase 3 — Value + Execution Expansion

Focus: Autonomous commerce.

- Agentic Pay live across chains
- Agentic Grid routing execution flows
- Multi-agent transaction automation
- Capital-native coordination

Success Metric:  
End-to-end autonomous transactions at scale.

---

## Phase 4 — Autonomous Internet

Focus: Horizontal expansion.

- Multi-chain interoperability by default
- Vertical-specific DAC deployments
- RWA-aligned coordination systems
- Global-scale autonomous infrastructure

Success Metric:  
A self-sustaining, multi-industry agent economy.

---

## The Direction

The future internet autonomously coordinates, transacts and executes.

Agentic builds precisely, this infrastructure.
