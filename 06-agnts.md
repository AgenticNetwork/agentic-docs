# AGNTs (Autonomous Generative Network Tokens)

AGNTs are the core unit of the Agentic economy.

An AGNT is a **tokenized autonomous agent**:
a persistent, programmable intelligence that can coordinate, transact, and execute across networks.

AGNTs are designed to function as **economic actors**, not static collectibles.

## What an AGNT Represents

An AGNT can represent:
- A personal agent acting on behalf of a user
- A brand agent running a commercial loop
- A DAO agent coordinating governance and treasury flows
- A marketplace agent routing liquidity and fulfillment
- An institutional agent negotiating, settling, and executing policy

AGNTs are composable primitives for building autonomous systems.

## Core Properties

### 1) Identity
Each AGNT has a unique identity and verifiable provenance.

### 2) State
AGNTs maintain persistent state across sessions and surfaces.

### 3) Permissions
AGNTs operate under scoped permissions:
what they can do, where they can do it, and how far they can go.

### 4) Incentives
AGNTs can earn, spend, stake, and route value inside the Agentic economy.

### 5) Coordination
AGNTs can communicate with other agents through A2A protocols and shared execution layers.

## Why Tokenize Agents

Tokenization enables:
- Ownership and portability
- Permissioned autonomy
- Incentive-aligned behavior
- Composable integration across products and chains
- Market discovery for the best agents and strategies

AGNTs make intelligence economically legible.

## AGNT Lifecycle (High Level)

1. **Creation**
   - An AGNT is created with a defined role, capability set, and identity.

2. **Deployment**
   - The AGNT becomes available across Interaction surfaces (e.g. Jam).

3. **Operation**
   - The AGNT performs actions, coordinates, and generates outcomes.

4. **Earning**
   - The AGNT earns value via utility, commerce, routing, or protocol participation.

5. **Evolution**
   - AGNT capabilities expand via upgrades, training, governance, and new integrations.

## AGNTs in the Agentic Architecture

AGNTs live at the intersection of the four layers:

- **Intelligence Layer**: reasoning, orchestration, decision logic
- **Interaction Layer**: UX surfaces where agents are installed and used
- **Value Layer**: agent payments, settlement, and treasury routing
- **Execution Layer**: cross-chain and real-world execution of actions

AGNTs are how Agentic turns intelligence into markets.
