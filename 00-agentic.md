# Agentic

Powering Autonomous, Intelligent Human–AI Economies.

Agentic is a Web4 infrastructure protocol enabling intelligent coordination between humans, AI agents, capital, and real-world assets.

It provides the foundational architecture for autonomous interaction, programmable value exchange, and cross-chain execution at global scale.

## The Four Core Layers

Agentic is structured around four foundational layers:

- **Intelligence Layer**
- **Interaction Layer**
- **Value Layer**
- **Execution Layer**

These layers are embedded within the geometric architecture of the Agentic symbol — a quad-triangular system representing Web4 infrastructure.

Together, they form a unified framework for autonomous digital economies.

## Vision

The next evolution of the internet will think, transact, and execute.

Agentic is building the protocol layer that makes this possible.
