# Agentic Network Token ($AGENTIC)

Agentic is secured and coordinated by a native network token: **$AGENTIC**.

$AGENTIC powers execution, aligns long-term incentives, and sustains protocol security through staking.

## Core Functions

- **Network Gas** — fees for on-chain execution and protocol operations
- **Staking Security** — validator staking and economic finality
- **Validator Alignment** — incentives for uptime, correctness, and performance
- **Governance Coordination** — protocol upgrades and parameter coordination (where applicable)
- **Productive Incentives** — distribution mechanisms designed to reward meaningful participation

## Design Principles

$AGENTIC is engineered as infrastructure-grade economics.

- **Utility-first architecture**
- **Sustainable issuance and incentive flows**
- **Clear alignment between users, builders, and validators**
- **Long-horizon security and stability**

## Role Within the Stack

Agentic is structured as an integrated Web4 system:

- **Jam AI** drives distribution
- **DACs** drive economic activity
- **Agentic Protocol** defines standards
- **Agentic Pay** routes value
- **Agentic Grid** executes

**$AGENTIC** secures and sustains the network that makes this coordination possible.

## Strategic Positioning

Agentic is global infrastructure for autonomous economies.

$AGENTIC is the coordination and security asset of that infrastructure.
