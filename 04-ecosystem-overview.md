# Ecosystem Overview

The Agentic ecosystem of DACs (Decentralized Autonomous Conglomerates) maps directly to the Four Core Layers.

This alignment ensures architectural clarity and long-term institutional grade scalability.

## Intelligence Layer → Agentic OS

The foundational operating system powering autonomous, cross-chain Human–AI economies. Agentic OS serves as the nervous system of the Agentic Internet.

- AGNT orchestration interface
- Cross-chain AGNT communication via CCIP
- Autonomous AGNT inference and coordination
- Institutional Web4 infrastructure

---

## Interaction Layer → Agentic OS

The consumer-centric social operating system of the Agentic Web4 era - built for mainstream, highly viral agentic consumer adoption flows at mass scale.

- A2A Messaging and communication through CCIP
- Human-AI-native experiences
- Livestreams
- Installable Agents

Agentic OS makes intelligence and agentic expression - accessible, globally.

## Value Layer → Orchard AI

The intelligent tokenized RWA liquidity exchange DAC of the Agentic ecosystem.

- Autonomous RWA sourcing
- Secure cross-chain liquidity routing via CCIP
- Verifiable procurement automation
- On-chain settlement

Orchard AI autonomously and intelligently cultivates intrinsic global economic value.

## Execution Layer → Chariot

The flagship global payments DAC of the Agentic Internet.

- Consumer accessible real-world asset payment flows
- Regulatory compliant capital routing
- Secure A2A value exchange via CCIP
- Autonomous payment rails with consumer privacy

Chariot converts intelligence into frictionless capital deployment.
