# Protocol Architecture

The Four Core Layers are implemented through modular protocol components.

---

## Intelligence Layer → Agentic Protocol

The coordination core.

- Autonomous agent logic
- Cross-chain interoperability
- AGNT token standards
- Decentralized intelligence orchestration

---

## Interaction Layer → Agentic Engine

The orchestration and developer layer.

- SDKs
- Agent deployment frameworks
- Conversational runtime environments
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication middleware

---

## Value Layer → Agentic Pay

The decentralized value routing layer.

- Agent-to-Agent settlement
- Treasury automation
- Cross-chain payment flows
- Autonomous transaction execution

Agentic Pay enables capital movement without friction.

---

## Execution Layer → Agentic Grid

The cross-chain execution mesh.

- Liquidity routing
- Agentic inference computation sourcing
- CCIP coordination
- On-chain action automation

The Grid ensures intelligence translates into real-world execution.

---

Together, these components form a unified Web4 infrastructure stack.

Intelligence → Interaction → Value → Execution.

This is the architecture of the Autonomous Internet.
