# Introduction to Web4

Web4 is the next phase of the internet.

Agentic provides this infrastructure via a new **coordination layer**.

Web2 connected people, and Web3 connected wallets, Web4 connects:

- Humans
- AI Agents
- Capital
- On-chain protocols
- Off-chain systems
- Real-world assets

…into **autonomous, intelligent economies**.

## The Shift

### Web2 → Interaction Internet
- Social graphs
- Platforms
- Feeds
- Centralized identity and distribution

### Web3 → Ownership Internet
- Wallets
- Tokens
- Permissionless markets
- Programmable value

### Web4 → Autonomous Internet
- Agents coordinate on behalf of users
- Payments execute automatically
- Systems negotiate and settle
- Value flows through intelligent routing
- Outcomes are produced, beyond the paradigm of web content

Web4 turns the internet from a place you browse into a system that acts.

## What Makes Web4 Different

### 1) Intelligence is native
Reasoning is embedded in the infrastructure layer.

### 2) Agents are first-class economic actors
Agents can hold identity, state, permissions, and incentives.
They can transact and coordinate across systems.

### 3) Value moves with intent
Transactions are driven by goals, as opposed to simple user interactions.
Payments become programmable actions.

### 4) Execution becomes autonomous
Actions are routed and verified across chains and real-world endpoints.

## Why Agentic Exists

Web4 requires a protocol layer built for autonomy.

Agentic provides:
- A framework for agent identity, coordination, and incentives
- A payment and settlement fabric for agent economies
- An execution mesh for cross-chain and real-world action
- A standard for tokenized autonomous agents (AGNTs)
- A unified architecture that scales from consumer UX to institutional rails

Agentic is infrastructure for the Autonomous Internet.
